VoiceCoder
==========

**Work in progress!**

Experiments with OpenAI and Python to edit code via voice input.

**Note:** This sends your code and voice to OpenAI!

This is meant for people that can't use their hands. Actual voice input isn't
supported yet, type `:` to write an edit command to be sent to OpenAI. `w` to
save (write) the file, `q` to quit (doesn't warn about unsaved changes).

You need to set the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` (can be in a `.env`
file in the current directory).
